 As I see now, there is no command completion like in regular powershell cli in windows for example, for completing commands like Import-Module,
 Invoke-WebRequest, and basically every built in command in powershell.
 Also local files and directories names completion is missing.

Here by, I suggest to add the following features:
1. Built in-command names completion.
2. Local file and directory names completion.

I really think that this would be helpful not just for me, but for many other pentesters that use your tool, as it will save a lot of time and effort,
and would make the tool even better in my opinion.

Thank you very much!
